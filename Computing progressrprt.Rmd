Goals for this project including creating an educational computer game for 2nd-3rd graders.
The game will consist of falling cubes containing mathematical equations. In order to fulfill the game's objective and obtain points, the answer to the mathematical  problem must be entered before the cube hits the "ground" and shatters.
Used resources will include the Unity game engine, and visual stude integrated development environment (IDE)
Current data we have generated include four 2-D cube shapes colliding with a square sprite, these images were generated in Unity.
These Unity files were uploaded under the file "assets" and uploaded to a public GitHub repository.
Each member will aid in the creation of the mathematical equations, shapes for the game, and coding of the movement of these shapes utilizing the Unity game engine.
